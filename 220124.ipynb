Lawyers for news organisations said it was \\\"really vital\\\" for the responses of 250 potential jurors to be made public \\\"to serve as a check on the process\\\". Santa Barbara County Superior Court is due to consider the request on Monday. Mr Jackson denies child molestation. It is estimated his trial will cost Santa Barbara county up to $4m (xc2xa32.13m).  Meanwhile Michael Jacksons mother has said she is \\\"100% certain\\\" her son did not commit the child abuse charges he faces. The court is currently selecting 12 jurors and eight stand-by jurors for the trial, a process delayed until at least Thursday after a member of the stars legal team was hit by family illness. Defence lawyers argued against the bid by Associated Press and other news organisations to have potential jurors responses made public.  \\\"The release of the completed jury questionnaires does not serve any purpose other than to add to the sensationalist coverage of this case,\\\" a motion by Mr Jacksons lawyers stated. The estimated total costs of the trial, expected to last five months, range from $2.5m (xc2xa31.33m) to $4m (xc2xa32.13m) of local taxpayers money. Those estimates do not include costs to the city of Santa Maria, the Superior Court or for the investigation and prosecution of the case. The cost of security and other needs around the courthouse has been estimated at $40,000 (xc2xa321,000) per day, said Jason Stilwell, a special projects manager at the county administrators office.  Mr Jackson, 46, denies plying a boy with alcohol and molesting him. His mother Katherine Jackson told US TV network Fox News on Sunday that her pop star son told her he was innocent. \\\"I believe that for one reason - I know his character,\\\" she said. \\\"He loves children. You dont molest anything that you love.\\\" Describing Mr Jackson as \\\"a good person\\\", the mother-of-nine said she feared he would not be given a fair trial. \\\"I cant sleep thinking about what these wicked people might try to do to him,\\\" she said. \",\n          \"Game firm holds cast auditions  Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.  The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for \\\"a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters\\\". Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performers fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.  \\\"There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,\\\" said Shauna Perry, Biowares audio and external resources producer. \\\"Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.\\\" She added: \\\"Not everyone is a model in the world so we dont want just models in our games.\\\" People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the persons head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. \\\"The 3D model will look exactly like the person - its really quite incredible how detailed they are,\\\" said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. \\\"We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. \\\"But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.\\\" \",\n          \"Citizenship event for 18s touted  Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.  The idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches \\\"inclusive citizenship\\\" particularly for ethnic minorities. A pilot scheme based on ceremonies in Australia will start in October. Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. Britains young black and Asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nations heritage as part of the governments new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \\\"other cultural identities\\\" alongside being British. The launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in Britain. On Monday school inspection chief David Bell, accused some Islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to British society.  The Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted boss Mr Bells comments were \\\"highly irresponsible\\\". The Home Office started work on its Community Cohesion and Race Equality Strategy last year and the outcome, launched on Wednesday, is called Improving Opportunity, Strengthening Society. It is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. \\\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\\\" said a Home Office spokesman. \\\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\\\" The spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south Asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.  \\\"It is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,\\\" the spokesman added. Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. He added: \\\"But while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. \\\"This strategy sets out the governments commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society.\\\" Some 8% of the UK population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 Census.  The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. But those of Pakistani, Bangladeshi and black Caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. The programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"labels\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"business\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"sport\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale baikals background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear  russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9 4bn (261bn roubles xc2xa34 8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas russias fourth-biggest oil producer many observers believe that the unit which produces 60% of yukos oil output could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom the state gas firm which opted out of the auction  the russian government forced the sale of yukos most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes yukos us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction on wednesday yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group  we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us  yukos spokesman mike lake told

interested in the development of yuganskneftegas president putin also suggested that chinas national petroleum corporation could play a role in the units future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a

conscience  the prime ministers spokesman set out mr blairs view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howards stance on abortions the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand  the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law  mr blairs spokesman said: the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context  his words came as cardinal cormac murphy oconnor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howards stance and distanced himself from labour in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue  saying: the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion  cardinal oconnor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said: we are not going to suggest people support one particular party  the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later more than 180 000 women in england and wales had terminations last year of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks  in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said: i believe abortion should be available to everyone but the law should be changed  in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20  all three main parties say the issue is one for each mps conscience rather than one where there is a party-wide policy mr howard stressed his views were his personal views shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews conducted as part of the magazines high heeled vote campaign  mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue  however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice  obviously there is a time beyond which you cant have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue  mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean i dont know what i would do now  the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff the most reverend peter smith told bbc radio 4s today programme that the church merely wanted people to reflect on issues in light of the gospel before voting anne

conscience  the prime ministers spokesman set out mr blairs view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howards stance on abortions the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are tantamount to abortion on demand  the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law  mr blairs spokesman said: the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context  his words came as cardinal cormac murphy oconnor the archbishop of westminster backed mr howards stance and distanced himself from labour in a statement he said abortion was a very key issue  saying: the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend on the way to a full abandonment of abortion  cardinal oconnor claimed labour had developed the notion that it was the natural party of catholics but he said: we are not going to suggest people support one particular party  the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later more than 180 000 women in

heeled vote campaign  mr blair who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion said abortion was a difficult issue  however much i dislike the idea of abortion you should not criminalise a woman who in very difficult circumstances makes that choice  obviously there is a time beyond which you cant have an abortion and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue  mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean i dont know what i would do now  the roman

a pressure control system which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers preventing ear popping  - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations  - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft   the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us  said masayuki shimono president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts the first record for the worlds fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955  as such it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition when the record was 426m per minute or 25 6 km/h less than half the speed of the new record  said hein le roux specialist researcher at the guinness world records taipeis tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur malaysia -
